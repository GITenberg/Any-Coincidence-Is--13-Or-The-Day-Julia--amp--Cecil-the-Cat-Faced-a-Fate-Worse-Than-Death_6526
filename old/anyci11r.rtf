\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab Kurt, aka. Butthead, hadn't replaced the dead bulbs yet, so Julia sat on a toilet lid inside a claustrophobic's nightmare of a stall with only pale, yellow light keeping her from absolute darkness.  And the brief flame of the lighter, which she snapped cl
osed as she took a strong, slow drag.  Another night-shift to deal with old grannies looking for denture cream, kids trying to lift cigarettes, drunks picking up plastic violets for the wife.  If only she didn't need to eat, Julia concluded, maybe she woul
dn't have to work in a world that seemed more than a little unreal.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab But then, that was the family legacy, wasn't it?  Seeing something that wasn't there, or worse: trying to see something that wasn't there and almost succeeding.  Find a farm out in Arizona and retire once you've had enough of being called crazy.  But then
, Julia knew that there were two kinds of people: those who couldn't live without air conditioning and her uncle.  Another run-down, fix-it-up farm in this family was out of the question.  She took another deep drag and wondered why she kept smoking these 
things.  They were like beer, Uncle Justin had told her: after the War, they never went back to making them right.  If only someone would just make some real changes in the world -- how long could it be before it was a better place to live?  A better place
 than this?  Wasn't that what everyone wanted?  If so, why did everyone settle for what they had?}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab That's what her mother had done.  Settled for Dad dying.  Settled for the life of a reclusive widow, until she died too.  Not much Julia could do but not make a conscious mess of her own life.  Not that everything had gone perfectly.  She had a job, she w
as going to school -- although Uncle Justin kept reminding her it was \ldblquote only\rdblquote  for accounting.  No science, no liberal arts.  But she read a lot on her own.  Mysteries, new fiction, the classics that were recommended by that stud of a librarian.  Not that sh

er of falling for the same trap his sister, Julia's mother, had fallen for:  living in a Wisconso-centric universe.  Once he brought this up, the conversation usually degenerated into combative silence.  They never settled that argument -- it just kept goi
ng on its own, to the detriment of everyone's sanity.  }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab Whether she was getting a real education or not, Julia found herself constantly searching for meaning.  About what governed reality (whatever that was), about what was human will (assuming it existed), about the elusive qualities of soul (love, happiness,
 etc.), and about the urge to bury one's face in Godiva chocolate every twenty-eight days.  The last question was more easily answered than the others.  She took a long drag, determined to make this one last.  One a day was bad enough, but she'd probably n
eed another one after work if Denny was in one of his moods.}

what the hell -- there would be an entire evening for worrying about mundane problems.  Like most of her dreams, she remembered it as another memory, one as real as a memory of a waking moment.   And as usual, the memory of the dream seemed more vivid than
 her memory of what she had done this morning.  }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab It came back to her  -- the light in the sky had been yellow, almost gold, with a brown tint.  That was what made it look so unusual, this dream-light.  It wasn't the sunlight of the world when everyone is awake and concentrating on whatever was going on 
beneath them.  A light reserved for people who didn't deserve it, or know what it was, or what it meant.  At least, that's what it seemed like in the dream.  Or maybe she had made all that up after she woke up.  But she did remember it had altered into a h
aze, growing more uniform, covering the world in a grey aura.  The white of the clouds gave way, under pressure of a great and unstoppable force, to something else, which she couldn't describe.  This, whatever it was, blanketed the sky, offering neither sn
ow nor rain, instead smothering the world below from whatever was above.  Except now, the clouds began to descend.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab In parallel streams, this gray sky, this aura seemed to move toward her.  Julia felt herself begin to giggle, that nervous giggle when she knew something was wrong but didn't know what.  And then she realized that she wasn't just remembering the dream -- 
the haze was overheard was coming through the ceiling, causing the restroom lights to bend and shimmer.  Julia stopped giggling and stared upward, her eyes fixed on whatever it was that she knew she had to be imagining.  But just as suddenly the gray haze 
retreated until it had returned to whatever unknown sky it had descended from. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab Julia felt her body constrict itself to form another giggle, but none came.  She stood up, tossed the butt into the toilet, and quickly lit another cigarette.  Nicotine euphoria swept through her body, but it would not take her to wherever it was she desp

\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab \ldblquote Now that was disappointing,\rdblquote  she muttered.  She felt her throat knot up with sadness until she heard someone move outside the door.  She looked at her watch -- she had wasted fifteen minutes, and now the restroom smelled terribly guilty.}

(the dog, named after Theodore rather than Franklin Delano) got killed.  It was getting hard to keep up the pretense, especially after the local vets started to compare notes.  But just when it seemed like half the town was talking about the Dog That Would
n't Die, Justin woke up and found Roosevelt laying by his feet, even though he had left him out in the back yard and shut the bedroom door.  Roosevelt was lying as content as he'd ever been, but dead.  A coincidence, to say the least.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab But if that had been the end, Justin wouldn't have thought of him so much.  It was years after his dog's death that he saw him again, standing in the front yard, ready to chase a ball if it ever got thrown again.  Justin had gone to the window, certain th
at his eyes were playing tricks on him, then more certain that they weren't.  Roosevelt just stood there, waiting.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab After Justin had summoned the courage to go outside, Roosevelt had led him the half-mile west to the new elementary school, up to the east-facing double-doors that opened into the kindergarten.  Inside, the darkness seemed not merely a lack of light but m

\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab He could not remember how he got home.  He was sitting in his easy-chair, looking outside at the darkness.  No Roosevelt.  No vision, nothing.  But his shoes were on, the soles stuck with wet grass.  Justin had trouble getting a few hours' sleep that nigh

he kindergarten class, Justin supposed.  Then Roosevelt was gone.  The ball had been retrieved, and a car behind him honked, but Justin couldn't drive on.  Instead, he parked his truck by the curb and walked to kindergarten the doors.  Inside, Mrs. Nolla w

 inside him was so bad he had trouble keeping his food down.  He kept noticing how his colleagues would look at him and whisper... or how their conversations would stop when he entered the room.  Finally, he resigned, sold everything, and moved to Arizona.

an empty beer can to him.  }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab After studying his situation carefully, he decided that he either must walk the three miles or try that new method of movement that was supposed to be listed in the gray section of the clipboard.  And considering that he hadn't exercised regularly in year

\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab With only the starlight behind him, he began to read his way through the higher math.  It wasn't easy, but at the end of four minutes, he decided that the section in question had to be interpreted subjectively.  This had been a theme of his academic caree
r, so the conclusion hadn't come as a surprise.  It was amazing how elastic a text could be given the right kind of reader.  In fact, he had often convinced himself (when lecturing to a room full of stupefied students) that only he and his method could arr
ive at any kind of coherent, but highly tentative, meaning.  When he had debated the subject years before, the experience of reading had come down to an indeterminacy that left out the possibility of conclusive understanding.  This disappointed many of his
 undergraduates, but then, reality was more often than not a disappointment.  His writings on the matter had taken him a long way at the beginning of his career, but after years of more ardent methods of spiritual exploration, late at night, with several f
riends keeping a bloodshot eye out for the police, his writing had lost something of the cohesiveness it once had.  He had always assumed that he would get it back one day, but lately, the face he encountered in the mirror looked more like his father's tha
n his own, and although he had taken some positive strides to get back into the lit. theory game, he hadn't enjoyed much success.  This new venture, however, seemed to be the turnaround.  Having this kind of power would turn not a few heads -- networking b
eing the prime ingredient in any good, tenured position.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab Skimming through the pages one last time, he decided that he had arrived at a justifiable understanding of the matter.  Perhaps he would make an entrance at the exact spot where he had left.  Or just outside the theater.  Or perhaps on the roof.  Too dram
atic?  He settled for just outside the theater's back door, in Seltsam Way.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab He closed his eyes in order to concentrate on the math, felt that peculiar sensation of vertigo, and felt a cool wind blow on his face.  He opened his eyes to find himself hovering a thousand feet above Tranquil.  His heart stopped beating as he began to 
fall, but began again, much to his relief as well as anguish.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab He nearly let go of the clipboard, but managed to clutch it to his chest as the pages, his clothes, and the Earth, began to flutter violently around him.  The fell past some kind of balloon, reached out to catch hold of it, but it was too late.  Now, the 
only thing that could save him were those few pages whose contents he had just forgotten, thanks to a somewhat reduced short-term memory.  The only numbers he could recall (as he struggled to find and not lose his place) was his rate of descent:  thirty-tw
o feet per second per second.  Something inside him wondered how long it would take to reach the end of his fall, and something else answered that this could not be known without ascertaining one's starting altitude.  Strange, he thought, what you think of
 when you find yourself airborne without a parachute.  But he forced himself to focus on what little he could read as he tumbled toward to the ground.  And though he had spent the bulk of his academic career teaching his students that truth, with its dupli
citous and mutable definitions, could never be found in a text, he began to search, quickly and sincerely, for meaning.}

Twenty, fifty, a hundred, it doesn't matter.  You make a car out of them for your grandchild, then take it apart.  You have the same number

\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab \ldblquote What if the Legos get lost?\rdblquote  Kurt asked.}

\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab \ldblquote OK, that's fairly simple,\rdblquote  said the Director.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab \ldblquote Now here's the problem.  We have a kind of energy called potential energy, and specifically I mean gravitational potential energy.  All potential energy is based on position, right?\rdblquote }

\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab \ldblquote No surprise,\rdblquote  Tom muttered.}

a, who came up behind him and kicked the back of his knee.  Denny went down, where Betty was trying to revive Ritchie.  She rubbed his face and his hands as he sat dazed against the opposite wall.  The Director stood against the concession counter, trying 
to concentrate in order to send everyone home, but unable to stay calm long enough to do any good.  }

 back and drop the board, his face red with claw marks.  She looked down in time to see Cecil jump into her arms.}

\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab \ldblquote How did you get here?\rdblquote }

What was it that she had read?  \ldblquote Nobody ever said a day has to be juggled into any kind of sense at day's end.'\ldblquote   What kind of crap was that!  Would a fight like this be taking pla
ce if life was meaningless?  Was it just by pretending that there was no structure to the world that got you through, detached and senseless to the lower orders of people beneath you?  If that were true (she noted as Denny brought a framed poster over the 
top of Ritchie's head), this lobby would be a lot easier to clean up in the morning.}

\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab Julia blinked and rubbed her eyes.  It was still there.  The mist was rolling across the floor at ankle level.  She tried to move out of its way, but it wrapped around her feet, and she could no longer move.  Whatever was really going on, if there really 
was a pattern hidden behind the curtain, behind the screen, from somewhere beneath the lowest pit in the theater, it was slowly creeping across the room.  None of the others noticed it as they kept up their insane combat, pounding each other as if the futu
re of the world depended on this last battle.  Outside, the city lights were fading in the fog, shimmering and melting in what seemed less like air and more like the bottom of a gray sea.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab What kind of author would treat their characters this way? Julia wondered, as she felt her shins being enveloped by whatever it was.  She struggled, but her legs would not move.  She tried walking, running, kicking.  All equally useless.  That is, until C
ecil rubbed his head against her chin and began to purr.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab Her left foot suddenly came loose, and she was able to take a step.  Then her right.  This couldn't be happening, she thought.  Totally irrational.  This doesn't make sense!  But she found herself muttering these thoughts as her legs carried her slowly to
ward the doors.  Outside the gray light had grown dark, as if the theater had been cut off from the rest of the world.  Perhaps the conspiracy had done it:  perhaps they had moved the theater to that 'somewhere else'.  Or maybe it was just payback time.  J
ulia didn't know, but she did know that, for this moment, the answer did not matter.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab As the fog swirled and filled the lobby, and as the muffled sounds of fighting echoed dully in her ears, she found herself at the doors.  She reached out and pushed them, and they swung open without resistance.  Behind her, she heard Uncle Justin call her
 name from somewhere in the lobby.  She looked back, but the room was completely filled by the nothing that had blown in.  Nothing was behind her, not even the lobby.  Her hand held the door open, as if the rest of them were about to follow her outside. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f0 \tab Cecil hopped out of her arm and landed at her feet.  He walked ahead into the darkness and looked back.  She could hear the others making their way toward her, but something was wrong.  It didn't sound like them anymore.  The footsteps were slow and heavy
, and she could no longer hear any voices.  The room had suddenly become so cold that Julia could see her breath.  She began to shiver, and the sounds of the footsteps were nearing.}
